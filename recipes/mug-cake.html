			<h2>Mug Cake Ingredients</h2>
			<p>
				You likely already have all the
				ingredients for this chocolate mug cake
				recipe on hand.
				<br />Here’s what you’ll need:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Flour: This easy chocolate mug cake
					recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sugar: Sugar sweetens things up and
					balances the bitter cocoa powder.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cocoa powder: Two tablespoons of
					unsweetened cocoa powder ensures a rich
					chocolate cake.
				</li>
				<li>
					Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a
					leavening agent, which means it helps
					the mug cake rise.
				</li>
				<li>
					Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the
					overall flavor of the mug cake, but it
					won’t make it taste salty.
				</li>
				<li>
					Milk: Milk keeps the cake batter from
					drying out during the microwaving
					process.
				</li>
				<li>
					Oil: A neutral oil, such as canola oil,
					keeps the batter moist without adding
					flavor.
				</li>
				<li>
					Water: A tablespoon of water helps
					create the perfect texture.
				</li>
				<li>
					Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract is
					the perfect finishing touch.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="Variation">
			<h2>Variation:</h2>
			<p>
				For a healthier version, use 1 1/2
				tablespoons of plain unsweetened
				applesauce instead of canola oil, and use
				3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon of water
				instead of milk.
