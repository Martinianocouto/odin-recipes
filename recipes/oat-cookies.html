    <h1>Chewy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies</h1>

    <p>
      I modified Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal cookies very slightly. I came up
      with these chocolate chip oatmeal cookies that my boyfriend went CRAZY
      over! I've never seen him enjoy cookies to that extent! He said I blew his
      mother's recipe away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever said oatmeal cookies are boring has clearly never tried this
      recipe. Seriously, what's up with people hating on oatmeal cookies? Once
      anyone tries these chocolate- and nut-packed oatmeal cookies, they won't
      have another bad word to say.

    <h1>How to Make Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <p>
      These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are super easy to mix up in a stand
      mixer or with your hand mixer. Simply cream together your butter (make
      sure it's soft for easy beating) and sugars. Then add the rest of the wet
      ingredients, then the rest of the dry ingredients. Mix in the quick oats,
      walnuts, and chocolate chips by hand so they don't get crushed. Luckily
      for you, these are drop cookies, so you don't even have to worry about
      working with the dough. Simply drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased
      baking sheets and bake them.

    <h1>What Are the Best Oats To Use For Cookies?</h1>
    <p>
      We know, the oat selection in the grocery store can be quite overwhelming.
      There's just so many options to choose from. For oatmeal chocolate chip
      cookies, you should use either quick-cooking oats (like in this recipe) or
      old-fashioned oats. Old-fashioned oats will give you chewier cookies than
      quick-cooking oats, if that's what you prefer.
    </p>
    <h1>How to Store Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <p>
      Store baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to
      two weeks. Though they probably won't last that long because you'll want
      to eat them all straight out of the oven!
    </p>
    <h1>How to Freeze Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <p>
      You can freeze oatmeal chocolate chip cookies both baked and unbaked. To
      freeze baked cookies, store them in layers with a piece of parchment paper
      in between each layer in airtight containers or zip-top bags (make sure to
      squeeze out the excess air). Freeze for up to three months. To freeze
      cookie dough, place the dough balls on a baking sheet and place them in
      the freezer until solid. After the dough is hardened, transfer it to a
      zip-top bag (with the excess air squeezed out) and freeze for up to three
      months. When you're ready to bake, thaw the cookie dough in the fridge
      overnight and bake at 325 degrees F. You may need to add a few extra
      minutes to the baking time — especially if the dough is still hard.
