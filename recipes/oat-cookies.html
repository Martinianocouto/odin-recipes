        <p>
            I modified Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal cookies very slightly.
            <br />I came up with these chocolate chip oatmeal cookies that my
            boyfriend went CRAZY over! <br />I've never seen him enjoy cookies
            to that extent! <br />He said I blew his mother's recipe away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whoever said oatmeal cookies are boring has clearly never tried this
            recipe.
            <br />Seriously, what's up with people hating on oatmeal cookies?
            <br />Once anyone tries these chocolate- and nut-packed oatmeal
            cookies, they won't have another bad word to say.

        <h2>How to Make Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are super easy to mix up in a
            stand mixer or with your hand mixer.
            <br />Simply cream together your butter (make sure it's soft for
            easy beating) and sugars. <br />Then add the rest of the wet
            ingredients, then the rest of the dry ingredients. <br />Mix in the
            quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips by hand so they don't get
            crushed. <br />Luckily for you, these are drop cookies, so you don't
            even have to worry about working with the dough. <br />Simply drop
            spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets and bake them.
        </p>
        <h2>What Are the Best Oats To Use For Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
            We know, the oat selection in the grocery store can be quite
            overwhelming.
            <br />There's just so many options to choose from. <br />For oatmeal
            chocolate chip cookies, you should use either quick-cooking oats
            (like in this recipe) or old-fashioned oats. <br />Old-fashioned
            oats will give you chewier cookies than quick-cooking oats, if
            that's what you prefer.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Store Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            Store baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for
            up to two weeks.
            <br />Though they probably won't last that long because you'll want
            to eat them all straight out of the oven!
        </p>
        <h2>How to Freeze Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            You can freeze oatmeal chocolate chip cookies both baked and
            unbaked.
            <br />To freeze baked cookies, store them in layers with a piece of
            parchment paper in between each layer in airtight containers or
            zip-top bags (make sure to squeeze out the excess air). <br />Freeze
            for up to three months. <br />To freeze cookie dough, place the
            dough balls on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer until
            solid. <br />After the dough is hardened, transfer it to a zip-top
            bag (with the excess air squeezed out) and freeze for up to three
            months. <br />When you're ready to bake, thaw the cookie dough in
            the fridge overnight and bake at 325 degrees F. <br />You may need
            to add a few extra minutes to the baking time — especially if the
            dough is still hard.
