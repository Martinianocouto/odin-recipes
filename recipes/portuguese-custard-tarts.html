				<li>Step 1<p></p>
					Combine flour, salt, and cold water in a
					bowl.
					<br />Mix with a wooden spoon until
					dough just comes together and pulls away
					from the sides of the bowl. <br />Dough
					should be sticky; adjust with more flour
					or water to achieve what's shown in the
					video.

					<div class="step-2">
				<li>Step 2<p></p>
					Transfer dough onto a well-floured
					surface.
					<br />Dust a little more flour over the
					top. <br />Knead for 1 to 2 minutes to
					form a round. Cover and let rest for 15
					to 20 minutes.

				</div>
					<div class="step-3">
				<li>Step 3<p></p>
					Roll dough into a square about
					1/8-inch-thick, dusting with flour as
					necessary; dough should still be sticky.
					<p></p>

					<div class="step-4">
				<li>Step 4<p></p>
					Spread 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the
					square using a silicone spatula, leaving
					a 1/2-inch border.
					<br />Flip the unbuttered side over the
					middle of the square and fold the
					opposite end over it like a letter.
					<br />Straighten the edges as needed.

					Turn dough with a bench scraper to
					unstick it from the counter; dust with
					flour.
					<br />Flip and sprinkle more flour on
					top. <br />Roll dough into a
					1/8-inch-thick rectangle, carefully
					stretching edges as needed. <br />Spread
					another 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of
					the dough.<br />Fold into thirds.<br />
					Transfer onto a lined baking sheet and
					freeze until butter is slightly chilled,
					about 10 minutes.

					Sprinkle dough with flour and roll into
					a square a little over 1/8-inch-thick.

					dough, leaving a 1- to 1 1/2-inch border
					on the top edge. <br />Dip your finger
					in water and lightly moisten the
					unbuttered edge. <br />Roll dough into a
					log starting from the bottom edge.
					<br />Dust with more flour and polish
					the ends as needed. <br />Seal with

				You'll have to decide whether you're going
				to include lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla,
				which are apparently considered optional
				ingredients in Portugal, but I really
				enjoy the flavor, and wouldn't change a
				thing.
				<br />You can substitute 1/4 teaspoon
				ground cinnamon for the cinnamon stick.
