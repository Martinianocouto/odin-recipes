			<h3>Steps:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Combine flour, salt, and cold water in a
					bowl.
					<br />Mix with a wooden spoon until
					dough just comes together and pulls away
					from the sides of the bowl. <br />Dough
					should be sticky; adjust with more flour
					or water to achieve what's shown in the
					video.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img

					alt=" flour, salt, and cold water in a bowl" />
				<li>
					Transfer dough onto a well-floured
					surface.
					<br />Dust a little more flour over the
					top. <br />Knead for 1 to 2 minutes to
					form a round. Cover and let rest for 15
					to 20 minutes.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-two.png"
					alt="dough onto a well-floured surface" />
				<li>
					Roll dough into a square about
					1/8-inch-thick, dusting with flour as
					necessary; dough should still be sticky.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-three.png"
					alt="dough into a square about 1/8-inch-thick" />
				<li>
					Spread 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the
					square using a silicone spatula, leaving
					a 1/2-inch border.
					<br />Flip the unbuttered side over the
					middle of the square and fold the
					opposite end over it like a letter.
					<br />Straighten the edges as needed.
					<p></p>
				</li>

					alt="folded dough" />

				<li>
					Turn dough with a bench scraper to
					unstick it from the counter; dust with
					flour.
					<br />Flip and sprinkle more flour on
					top. <br />Roll dough into a
					1/8-inch-thick rectangle, carefully
					stretching edges as needed. <br />Spread
					another 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of
					the dough.<br />Fold into thirds.<br />
					Transfer onto a lined baking sheet and
					freeze until butter is slightly chilled,
					about 10 minutes.
					<p></p>

				</li>
				<li>
					Sprinkle dough with flour and roll into
					a square a little over 1/8-inch-thick.
					<br />Spread remaining butter over the
					dough, leaving a 1- to 1 1/2-inch border
					on the top edge. <br />Dip your finger
					in water and lightly moisten the
					unbuttered edge. <br />Roll dough into a
					log starting from the bottom edge.
					<br />Dust with more flour and polish
					the ends as needed. <br />Seal with
					plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2
					hours, preferably overnight.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-six.jpg"
					alt="rolling dough" />
				<li>
					Combine sugar, 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon
					water, cinnamon, and lemon zest in a
					pot.
					<br />Boil over medium heat, without
					stirring, until syrup reaches 210 to 215
					degrees F (100 degrees C). <br />Remove
					from heat.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-seven.jpg"
					alt="boilling pot" />
				<li>
					<p></p>
					Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F (288
					degrees C).
					<br />Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Whisk flour, salt, and cold milk
					together very thoroughly in a cold pot.
					<br />Cook over medium heat, whisking
					constantly, until milk thickens, about 5
					minutes. <br />Remove from heat and let
					cool for at least 10 minutes.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-nine.jpg"
					alt="mixing pot" />
				<li>
					Whisk egg yolks into the cooled milk.
					<br />Add sugar syrup and vanilla
					extract. <br />Mix until combined.
					<br />Strain custard into a glass
					measuring cup.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-ten.jpg"
					alt="mixing ingredients" />
				<li>
					Unwrap the dough and trim any uneven
					bits on the ends.
					<br />Score log into 12 even pieces
					using a knife; cut through.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-eleven.jpg"
					alt="knife and dough" />
				<li>
					Place a piece of dough in each muffin
					cup.
					<br />Dip your thumb lightly in some
					cold water. <br />Press your thumb into
					the center of the swirl; push dough
					against the bottom and up the sides of
					the cup until it reaches least 1/8 inch
					past the top.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-twelve.jpg"
					alt="muffin cup with dough" />
				<li>
					Fill each cup 3/4 of the way with
					custard.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-thirteen.jpg"
					alt="muffin cup" />
				<li>
					Bake in the preheated oven until the
					pastry is browned and bubbly, and the
					tops start to blister and caramelize,
					about 12 minutes.
					<p></p>
				</li>
				<img
					src="../images/steps-custard/step-fourteen.jpg"
					alt="muffic cup" />
				<li>
					Cool tarts briefly and serve warm.
					<br /><b>Enjoy!</b>

			<h2>Chef's Notes:</h2>
			<p>
				You'll have to decide whether you're going
				to include lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla,
				which are apparently considered optional
				ingredients in Portugal, but I really
				enjoy the flavor, and wouldn't change a
				thing.
				<br />You can substitute 1/4 teaspoon
				ground cinnamon for the cinnamon stick.
